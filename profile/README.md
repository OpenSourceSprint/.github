## About

**Open-Source Sprint** is a team-based event organized by the Open-Source Club at VIT Bhopal University. In this organization, we host repositories covering different domains. Participants, in teams of four, create a GitHub organization, add their teammates, fork the selected repositories and send pull request after solving the issues.

## How It Works

1. **Create a GitHub Organization:** As a participant, the first step is to create a GitHub organization for your team.
2. **Choose Your Domain:** Explore our repositories covering a wide range of domains.
3. **Fork & Conquer:** Select a repository of your interest, fork it, and get ready to contribute.
4. **Solve Issues:** Dive into the code, tackle issues, and showcase your problem-solving skills. Each repository will contain issues, each assigned with points and difficulty modes:
   - Easy: 10 points
   - Medium: 30 points
   - Hard: 50 points
5. **Send a Pull Request:** After solving all the issues, teams are required to send the pull request. The team who solves all the issues and accumulates the most points will be declared the winner.
